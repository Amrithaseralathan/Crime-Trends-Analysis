"A Comprehensive PDF Report of Crime Data Over the Years"
The Crime Trends Analysis project aims to perform exploratory data analysis and visualization of crime data collected over several years. The project generates a detailed and comprehensive report in PDF format that provides an overview of crime trends, patterns and changes over time. The analysis helps to understand the dynamics of criminal activity and can inform decision-making, resource allocation and law enforcement strategies.
